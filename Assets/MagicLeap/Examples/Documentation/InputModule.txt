# Example Scene: InputModule

This example scene demonstrates the MLInputModule, which implements a seamless integration
between Magic Leap input (Headpose, Eye Tracking, and Controls) with the native Unity
UI elements.

Upon launching the application you will see a menu that you can interact with using the
device Headpose or the Control(s). While a button is being hovered, use the Trigger on the
Control(s) to press and activate the selected button.
